## Overview

The **centraldogma** package enables you to simulate and process DNA sequences into RNA, codons, and amino acids, ending with a barplot of amino acid counts. This vignette demonstrates the five functions in the package.

### Step 1: Generate a DNA Sequence

We start by generating a random DNA sequence of a specified length. Here, `generate_sequence()` takes a single parameter, `sequence_length`, and returns a random DNA sequence.

```{r}
# Generate a random DNA sequence
sequence_length <- 100
dna_sequence <- generate_sequence(sequence_length)
dna_sequence
```

### Step 2: Transcription - Converting DNA to RNA

The `transcription()` function converts the DNA sequence to an RNA sequence by replacing thymine (T) with uracil (U).

```{r}
# Transcribe the DNA sequence to RNA
rna_sequence <- transcription(dna_sequence)
rna_sequence
```

### Step 3: Convert RNA to Codons

The `RNA_to_codon()` function splits the RNA sequence into codons (groups of three nucleotides). By default, the function starts at the first position.

```{r}
# Convert RNA sequence to codons
codons <- RNA_to_codon(rna_sequence)
codons
```

### Step 4: Translate Codons to Amino Acids

With `aa_sequence()`, the codons are translated into their corresponding amino acids. This function requires a predefined **codon table** named `codon_table` that maps each codon to an amino acid.

```{r}
# Translate codons to amino acid sequence
amino_acid_sequence <- aa_sequence(codons)
amino_acid_sequence
```

### Step 5: Visualize Amino Acid Counts

Finally, `colplot_number_aa_in_protseq()` takes the amino acid sequence and generates a barplot of amino acid counts.

```{r}
# Plot amino acid counts
colplot_number_aa_in_protseq(amino_acid_sequence)
```

## Use cases

The **centraldogma** package is small and specific, making it a good package used for educational purposes. It provides a simple way for students and teachers to understand the central dogma of molecular biology by visually representing the process from DNA to protein.
Furthermore, the package can also be used as a bioinformatic tool for easily discovering the pattern of amino acids in given DNA, RNA, or amino acid sequences.

## Future package potentials

While the **centraldogma** package currently provides essential functions, several additional features could enhance its utility. Such feature could be mutatuon simulation, a function to simulate mutations in DNA sequences for further analysing their effect on the protein sequence. Another potential feature could be an expanded codon table, which would include additional genetic codes for organisms that uses non-standarda codons. Lastly, a protein structure prediction function could be implemented to examine the potential protein structure of your protein.

## A concluding mark

Even though there is a unlimited potential in expanding packages such as **centraldogma** it is important to limit the dependencies in the package to ensure a more efficient and maintainable package and a more user-friendly experience. \n
To provide such user-friendly experience, it is important tp consider the pros and cons of choosing between the `@importFrom` and `package::function()`. Using `@importFrom` enhances code readability and performance by allowing direct function calls, but it can obscure function origins and cause confusion with similarly named functions. In contrast, `package::function()` clarifies function sources and avoids namespace conflicts, making dependencies clearer for users, so a balance between both methods can improve maintainability.
